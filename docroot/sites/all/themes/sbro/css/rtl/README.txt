I moved all of the right-to-left css sheets into this folder 
because we probably won't need them for the proof of concept.
To reverse this change, simply put all the css sheets within 
/css/rtl  back into /css. And for the ones that are in css/rtl/layout,
move them into css/layout. Then delete the folders css/rtl, 
and css/rtl/layout.
